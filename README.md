# JS-Calc

A simple JavaScript calculator, modeled after math class of yester-year. Performs basic arithmetic and the four base memory functions - as well as a few fun design elements as easter eggs! (90s kids unite, do you know how to write hello?)

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Sass
- jQuery

### Project Planning and Development
This project was undertaken as an attempt to re-do an earlier, bug-ridden project - incorporating many of the techniques and best practices learnt thus far in the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly, Boston.  This approach proved very interesting (read, encouraging!) as it highlighted many of the gains and strides made in just a few short weeks.
The simple functionality of the app proved a backend unnecessary, and thus it was omitted - but extra consideration was taken for a few fun 'extras' in styling an UI/UX

### Going Forward
Goals for future development might include additional functionality to this "calculator" or (perhaps more inline with maintaining it's 90s aesthetic!) offering some sort of "toggle" to another calculator (perhaps mimicing a scientific or graphing calculator?) that offers any additional functionality
Also, more easter eggs!
